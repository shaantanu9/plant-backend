# Progress

## What Works
- Core project structure is set up (Express, TypeScript, routes, middleware).
- API documentation generation mechanism (`npm run docs`) is in place.
- Code quality tooling (ESLint, Prettier) is configured.
- Build process (`npm run build`) is defined.
- Comprehensive logging system is implemented.
- Memory bank structure is initialized.

## What's Left to Build
- Full implementation of all API endpoints defined in the README (Containers, Deliveries, Users, Subscriptions, Analytics).
- Implementation of business logic within controllers and services.
- Database schema definitions (`models`/`entity`) and interactions.
- Socket.IO event handling logic needs completion (e.g., `bookmark-ai-chat` logic in `app.ts`).
- Test suite implementation (`npm test`).
- Deployment setup.

## Current Status
- The project has a well-defined structure and core setup based on the README and initial codebase analysis.
- Foundational elements like routing, middleware, logging, and build processes are established.
- Memory Bank has been updated with information from the README and codebase analysis.

## Known Issues
- MongoDB connection needs verification and potential setup if not already running.
- Business logic for API endpoints is not yet implemented.
- Socket.IO event handlers are placeholders.
- Test coverage is likely minimal or non-existent.
