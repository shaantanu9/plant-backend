# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- Understanding the existing codebase and project structure based on README and file analysis.
- Updating the Memory Bank documentation.

## Recent Changes
- Analyzed `README.md` and codebase structure.
- Updated `projectbrief.md` and `productContext.md`.

## Next Steps
- Continue updating other Memory Bank files (`systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`).
- Potentially dive deeper into specific code modules (e.g., controllers, services) for more detailed understanding if requested.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Ensuring Memory Bank accurately reflects the project's state and purpose as described in the README.
